## Installation and Build
The docker image has to be build manually based on [oehrlis/docker-tvd](https://github.com/oehrlis/docker-tvd) from GitHub. Due to license restrictions from Oracle I can not provide this image on a public Docker repository (see [OTN Developer License Terms](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/licenses/standard-license-152015.html)). The required Software has to be downloaded prior image build. Alternatively it is possible to specify MOS credentials in ```scripts/.netrc``` or via build arguments.

### Obtaining Product Distributions
The Oracle Software required to setup an Oracle Unified Directory docker image is basically not public available. It is subject to Oracle's license terms. For this reason a valid license is required (eg. [OTN Developer License Terms](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/licenses/standard-license-152015.html)). In addition, Oracle's license terms and conditions must be accepted before downloading.

The following software is required for the Oracle Unified Directory docker image:
* Oracle Java Development Kit (JDK) 1.8 (1.8u144)
* Oracle Unified Directory 12.2.1.3.0
* Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure 12.2.1.3.0

The software can either be downloaded from [My Oracle Support (MOS)](https://support.oracle.com), [Oracle Technology Network (OTN)](http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/index.html) or [Oracle Software Delivery Cloud (OSDC)](http://edelivery.oracle.com). The follwing steps will refere to the MOS software download to simplify the build process.

### Manual download Software
Simplest method to build the OUD image is to manually download the required software. However this will lead to bigger docker images, since the software is copied during build, which temporary blow up the container file-system. But its more safe because you do not have to store any MOS credentials.

The corresponding links and checksum can be found in ```*.download``` files in the ```software```folder. Alternatively the Oracle Support Download Links:
* Oracle Java Server JRE 8 update 144 [Patch 26512979](https://updates.oracle.com/ARULink/PatchDetails/process_form?patch_num=26512979) or [direct](https://updates.oracle.com/Orion/Services/download/p26512979_180144_Linux-x86-64.zip?aru=21443434&patch_file=p26512979_180144_Linux-x86-64.zip)
* Oracle Unified Directory 12.2.1.3.0 [Patch 26270957](https://updates.oracle.com/ARULink/PatchDetails/process_form?patch_num=26270957) or [direct](https://updates.oracle.com/Orion/Services/download/p26270957_122130_Generic.zip?aru=21504981&patch_file=p26270957_122130_Generic.zip)
* Oracle Fusion Middleware Infrastructure 12.2.1.3.0 [Patch 26269885](https://updates.oracle.com/ARULink/PatchDetails/process_form?patch_num=26269885) or [direct](https://updates.oracle.com/Orion/Services/download/p26269885_122130_Generic.zip?aru=21502041&patch_file=p26269885_122130_Generic.zip)

Copy both files to the ```software```folder.

    cp p26512979_180144_Linux-x86-64.zip docker-oud/software
    cp p26270957_122130_Generic.zip docker-oud/software
    cp p26269885_122130_Generic.zip docker-oud/software

Build the docker image either by using ```docker build``` or ```build.sh```.

    docker build -t oehrlis/oudsm .

    scripts/build.sh

### Automatic download with .netrc
The advantage of an automatic software download during build is the reduced image size. No additional image layers are created for the software and the final docker image is about 3GB smaller. But the setup script (```setup_oud.sh```) requires the MOS credentials to download the software with [curl](https://linux.die.net/man/1/curl). Curl does read the credentials from the ```.netrc``` file in ```scripts``` folder. The ```.netrc``` file will be copied to ```/opt/docker/bin/.netrc```, but it will be removed at the end of the build.

Create a ```.netrc``` file with the credentials for *login.oracle.com*.

    echo "machine login.oracle.com login <MOS_USER> password <MOS_PASSWORD>" >docker-oud/scripts/.netrc

Build the docker image either by using ```docker build``` or ```build.sh```.

        docker build -t oehrlis/oudsm .

        scripts/build.sh

### Automatic download with Build Arguments
This method is similar to the automatic download with ```.netrc``` file. Instead of manually creating a ```.netrc``` file it will created based on build parameter. Also with this method the ```.netrc``` file is deleted at the end.

Build the docker image with MOS credentials as arguments.

    docker build --build-arg MOS_USER=<MOS_USER> --build-arg MOS_PASSWORD=<MOS_PASSWORD> -t oehrlis/oudsm .

### Setup Oracle Unified Directory Instance
So far this part has not yet been automated. Never the less you can create a container and manually create your OUD instance with ```oud-setup``` or ```oud-setup-proxy```.

		docker run -v [<host mount point>:]/u01 --name OUD-Engineering oehrlis/oudsm
		docker start -ai OUD-Engineering
